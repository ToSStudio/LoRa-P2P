# LoRa-P2P
experimenting with two SX1278 on 433 MHz. One is driven by an Arduino UNO. The Datalines are 5V-tolerant. The SX1278 can be supplied with 3.3 V from the UNO. It can deliver sufficient to run the Module at full power (130 mA).
Full power is rarely necessary due to the great link-budget LoRa does offer.
One SX1278 is connected to a SEEEDUINO XIAO which come natively with 3.3 V. Connections to the Arduino boards are in the programme-files.
